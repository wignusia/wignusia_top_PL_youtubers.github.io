## Objective

### What is the key pain point?

The Head of Marketing wants to identify the top YouTubers in Poland in 2024 to determine which creators would be the most suitable for marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.
The dashboard integrates real-time 2026 data via the YouTube API to ensure up-to-date performance metrics.

### What is the ideal solution?

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top Polish YouTubers in 2024, including:

- Subscriber count  
- Total views  
- Total videos  
- Engagement metrics  

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

#User story
As the Head of Marketing, I want to identify the top YouTubers in Poland based on subscriber count, videos uploaded and views accumulated, so that I can decide on which channels would be best to run marketing campaigns with to generate a good ROI. 

# Data Source

### What data is needed to achieve our objective?
We need data on the top YouTubers in Poland for 2024, including their:
* **Channel names**
* **Total subscribers**
* **Total views**
* **Total videos uploaded**

### Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from **Kaggle** (via an Excel extract). You can find the original dataset here: [Kaggle YouTube Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download).

> **Note:** This project uses the 2024 Kaggle dataset as the baseline list of YouTube channels. Performance metrics—such as subscribers, views, and video counts—are dynamically updated using real-time **2026 data** fetched via the **YouTube API**.
